# Author Management System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Author management system for the Phoenix Press news website, replacing the previous text-based author fields with a proper relational database model supporting bilingual content (English/Arabic).

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- **New Author Model** (`schema.prisma`):
  - `nameEn` - English name (required)
  - `nameAr` - Arabic name (optional)
  - `country` - Author's country
  - `bio` / `bioAr` - Bilingual biography
  - `email` - Contact email
  - `avatar` - Profile picture URL
  - `socialLinks` - JSON field for social media
  - `isActive` - Status flag
  - Soft deletion support (`deletedAt`)

- **Updated Post Model**:
  - Added `postAuthorId` (required) - Reference to Author table
  - Kept `authorId` (optional) - Reference to User table for system users
  - Removed old `authorName` and `authorNameArabic` text fields

### 2. Database Migration
- **Successfully migrated existing data**:
  - Preserved all 12 existing posts
  - Created Author records from old `authorName` fields
  - Assigned posts without authors to "Default Author"
  - Zero data loss during migration

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Admin API (`/api/admin/authors/`)
- **GET** - List authors with pagination, search, and post counts
- **POST** - Create new authors with validation
- **GET /[id]** - View individual author with posts
- **PUT /[id]** - Update author information
- **DELETE /[id]** - Soft delete (prevents deletion if author has posts)

#### Public API (`/api/authors/`)
- **GET** - Fetch active authors for frontend use

### 4. Admin Interface

#### Authors Management Page (`/admin/authors/`)
- **Table view** with search functionality
- **Pagination** for large datasets
- **Author information display**:
  - English and Arabic names
  - Country and email
  - Post count badges
  - Active/inactive status

- **Bilingual support**: English and Arabic inputs
- **Social media links**: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram
- **Validation**: Required fields and email format
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages
- **RTL support**: Proper Arabic text direction

### 5. Navigation Integration
- **Added "Authors" link** to admin navigation header
- **Permission-based access** with `view_authors` permission
- **Active state detection** for current page highlighting

### 6. Package Management
- **Fixed package manager**: Switched from npm to pnpm (project standard)
