# Admin Post Preview Solution

## Problem
When admins clicked "View" on unpublished posts in the admin dashboard, they would get a 404 error because the public post route (`/posts/[slug]`) only shows published posts.

## Solution
Created an admin preview system that allows viewing unpublished posts without affecting the public site.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Admin Preview Route
**File:** `src/app/admin/posts/preview/[slug]/page.tsx`

- **Purpose:** Allows admins to preview unpublished posts
- **Features:**
  - Shows posts regardless of status (DRAFT, WAITING_APPROVAL, etc.)
  - Displays a yellow banner indicating it's an admin preview
  - Shows current post status
  - Includes "Back to Edit" link
  - Same styling and functionality as public posts
  - Includes all post data (translations, media, tags, etc.)

### 2. Updated Admin Content Page
**File:** `src/app/admin/content/page-client.tsx`

- **Smart View Links:** 
  - **Published posts:** Link to public URL (`/posts/[slug]`) - "View"
  - **Unpublished posts:** Link to admin preview (`/admin/posts/preview/[slug]`) - "Preview"
- **Visual Indicators:**
  - Published posts: Gray "View" link
  - Unpublished posts: Yellow "Preview" link
- **Tooltips:** Helpful hover text explaining the difference

## How It Works

### For Published Posts
1. Admin clicks "View" → Opens public post URL
2. Shows the post as visitors see it
3. Normal public post experience

### For Unpublished Posts  
1. Admin clicks "Preview" → Opens admin preview URL
2. Shows yellow banner: "Admin Preview: This is how the post will look when published"
3. Displays current status (DRAFT, WAITING_APPROVAL, etc.)
4. Includes "← Back to Edit" link
5. Same content and styling as published version

## Benefits

✅ **No More 404 Errors** - Admins can always preview posts  
✅ **Clear Status Indication** - Shows current post status  
✅ **Easy Navigation** - Quick return to edit mode  
✅ **Consistent Experience** - Same styling as public posts  
✅ **No Public Impact** - Unpublished posts remain hidden from public  
✅ **Bilingual Support** - Works with Arabic and English content  

## Technical Details

### Database Queries
- Admin preview route doesn't filter by `PostStatus.PUBLISHED`
- Public route still maintains the published-only filter
- Both routes include the same relations (translations, media, tags, etc.)

### Security
- Preview route is under `/admin/` path
- Requires admin authentication (inherited from admin layout)
- No impact on public SEO or indexing

### URL Structure
- **Public posts:** `/posts/[slug]`
- **Admin preview:** `/admin/posts/preview/[slug]`
- **Edit posts:** `/admin/posts/[id]/edit`

## Usage

### For Content Managers
1. Create/edit a post
2. Click "Preview" to see how it will look
3. Make adjustments if needed
4. Publish when ready

### For Editors
1. Submit post for approval
2. Use "Preview" to check content
3. Senior editors can preview before approving

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- **Real-time preview** - Live updates as you type
- **Side-by-side editing** - Edit and preview simultaneously  
- **Version comparison** - Compare different versions
- **Mobile preview** - Test mobile responsiveness
