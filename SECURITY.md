# Security Documentation

## üîí Security Measures

### Environment Variables
- All sensitive environment variables are stored in `.env` files (not committed to git)
- Production environment variables are managed securely on the server
- No hardcoded secrets in the codebase

### Build Security
- `.next/` directory is excluded from git via `.gitignore`
- Sensitive build files are cleaned before deployment
- Server-side environment references are removed from production builds

### Deployment Security
- Secure deployment script removes sensitive files before deployment
- Production builds are cleaned of development artifacts
- Environment variables are properly isolated

## üö® Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### Issue: Environment Variable Exposure
**Problem:** The `.next/server/server-reference-manifest.js` file contained references to `process.env.NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

**Solution:** 
1. Added build cleaning script to remove sensitive files
2. Updated deployment process to clean builds before deployment
3. Added `build:secure` script that automatically cleans sensitive files

## üîß Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use `.env.example` for documentation
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use strong, unique secrets for each environment

### Build Process
- Always use `npm run build:secure` for production builds
- Clean sensitive files before deployment
- Verify no environment references remain in build artifacts

### Deployment
- Use secure deployment script
- Verify file permissions on server
- Monitor for unauthorized access

## üìã Security Checklist

- [x] Environment variables properly secured
- [x] Build artifacts cleaned of sensitive data
- [x] Deployment process secured
- [x] SSL/HTTPS configured
- [x] Server access properly restricted
- [x] Database connections secured
- [x] API endpoints protected

## üõ°Ô∏è Ongoing Security

1. **Regular Updates:** Keep dependencies updated
2. **Monitoring:** Monitor for security issues
3. **Backups:** Regular secure backups
4. **Access Control:** Limit server access
5. **SSL Renewal:** Ensure SSL certificates auto-renew
